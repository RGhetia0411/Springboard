Springboard SCOTUS Capstone Proposal

What is the problem you want to solve?

How the absence of Justice Scalia (or the potential addition of Judge Gorsuch) affect the outcomes of future court cases.

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem?  

The audience will be historians, lawyers, policy makers, and law schools.  The Supreme Court rules on cases that shape the fabric of the nation.  

What data are you going to use?  
The data I will be using for this project will be from http://scdb.wustl.edu/      
It is justice-centered data, which includes a set of justice votes for each dispute, along with the case information.  The unit of analysis is the vote.  The cases are organized by issue/ legal provision.  The data set includes one set of justice votes for each issue and legal provision dealt with by the Court for each docket.  The formats available for the data include:  CSV, DTA, POR, RDATA, SAV, XLSX, and XPT.  

Deliverables:  
I plan on using this data set to find a pattern of how the justices vote amongst each other on different issues/ legal provisions to understand how Justice Scalia voted and how Judge Gorsuch could affect the outcome of future cases.
